# Temporal Difference Based Actor Critic
Implementation of Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG) algorithm in progress.

# Dependencies
* Python 2.7 or 3.5
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 1.10
* [gym](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gym)
* [numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy)
* [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm) progress-bar

# Features
- Using a neural network based deterministic policy as the actor
- Using a Q-network as the critic
- Using Deterministic Policy Gradient Theorem to update critic
